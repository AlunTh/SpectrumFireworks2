Semi-random launch to hit a particular point and time.

Say that target is at (tx,ty) at t=0, assume that launch takes place at some
t<0

We need to compute:
	Launch x,y , vx, vy and lifetime
	
(after we've computed this, for a set of targets to be hit at the same time,
we can them bump them up by adding -(min(t)) to all of them)

Can compute launch vx, vy and lifetime separately. vy and lifetime are more important
to do first.

Minimum vy will be that required to just reach the altitude

y= 1/2 a t^2
t^2 = 2y / a
t_min = SQRT(2y/a) 

vy_min = t_min*a

Maximum vy will be that required to just reach the top of the screen (Ymax)

t_Ymax = SQRT(2Ymax/a)

vy_max = t_Ymax*a
